Saw a <a href="https://youtu.be/UW5bcsax78I" target="_blank">cool video</a> on Youtube, wanted to recreate that effect in Code.

First I wrote a (Python) code to take any GIF and get its frames.

Frames are then processed by another Python code to make the Fuzzy background image.

P5 JS moving black rectangles are laid on top to make the animation.
