I was a part of my college TEDx team and wanted to make an installation for putting up on the event day.</p>\n<p>The idea was that we would have a large screen(like a tv) with a webcam(I had also thought of putting up a row of these setups along a long wall. But budget concerns...). It would only have two eyes on the screen which would \"look\" at whoever passed by...I had done this using (iirc) OpenCV Face Detection...</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the idea was scrapped for some reasons...</p>\n<p>I must have code lying around somewhere though..I'll check and put it up on Github if possible..</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Eyes!","author":"Sourav Kulkarni","date":"10 August, 2017"},"excerpt":"Back in my college days, I had a friend who had big eyes!
